# Valentines-Day-Personal-Project
Personal Project: This is a personal project I created as a gift to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. In this project when you press the "no" button it displays a random text from its given list and the yes button grows 7x its original size. When the "yes" button is pressed you are taken to a new screen with a Valentine's Day message!
